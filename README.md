# classtest_homie

##Why such a scrapper ?

Most of us now a days have online test through Google Forms, we spend lot of time copy pasting the question to google and clickong on the first link and then going back and clicking 2nd link in case you dont find the first useful. It may sound easy, but when time in involved, this costs a lot of time. 
No more multiple copy pasting. 
Just copy paste the Google form link and links are infornt of you a click away.

##How to use
```bash
gh repo clone nandakishormpai2001/classtest_homie

cd classtest_homie

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Copy the Form  link to be inputted 

```bash
python maboi.py
```
